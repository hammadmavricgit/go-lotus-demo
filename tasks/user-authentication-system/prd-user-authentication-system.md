# Product Requirements Document: User Authentication System

## Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for building a production-ready user authentication system for a Next.js 15 application. The system will provide secure email and password-based authentication using PostgreSQL as the database and Prisma ORM for data management. The goal is to create a complete authentication foundation without relying on external auth providers like NextAuth.

## Goals

1. **Secure User Registration**: Allow users to create accounts with email and password, with proper password hashing and validation
2. **Secure User Login**: Provide secure login functionality with JWT token generation
3. **Database Integration**: Implement proper database schema and Prisma integration
4. **Frontend Integration**: Create functional login and registration forms
5. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
6. **Security Best Practices**: Follow security best practices for password handling and token management

## User Stories

1. **As a new user**, I want to register with my email and password so that I can create an account and access the application
2. **As a registered user**, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my account
3. **As a user**, I want to see clear error messages when registration or login fails so that I understand what went wrong
4. **As a user**, I want to be automatically logged in after registration so that I don't have to log in separately
5. **As a user**, I want to be redirected to the dashboard after successful login so that I can access the main application features
6. **As an unauthenticated user**, I want to be automatically redirected to the login page when I try to access protected routes so that I know I need to authenticate
7. **As an authenticated user**, I want to access the home page (`/`) and see my dashboard so that I can immediately access my account features
8. **As an authenticated user**, I want to be prevented from accessing the auth page so that I don't see login forms when already logged in

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Registration (`/api/register`)

- The system must accept POST requests with email and password in the request body
- The system must validate email format using basic email validation
- The system must prevent duplicate email registrations
- The system must hash passwords using bcrypt before storing in the database
- The system must store user data in PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- The system must return a JWT token upon successful registration
- The system must return appropriate error messages for validation failures

### 2. User Login (`/api/login`)

- The system must accept POST requests with email and password in the request body
- The system must validate user credentials against the database
- The system must compare hashed passwords using bcrypt
- The system must generate and return a JWT token upon successful authentication
- The system must return appropriate error messages for invalid credentials

### 3. Database Schema

- The system must include a User model with the following fields:
  - `id` (primary key, auto-generated)
  - `email` (unique, required, max length 255)
  - `firstName` (optional text)
  - `lastName` (optional text)
  - `hashed_password` (required text)
  - `status` (enum: Active, Inactive, Delete, default: Active)
  - `role` (enum: admin, staff, default: staff)
  - `created_at` (timestamp, auto-generated)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp, auto-updated)

### 4. Prisma Integration

- The system must include a Prisma client utility (`lib/prisma.ts`)
- The system must support hot reloading in development environment
- The system must use environment variables for database configuration
- The system must include proper database connection handling

### 5. Frontend Forms

- The system must include a registration form with email and password fields
- The system must include a login form with email and password fields
- The system must use React useState for form state management
- The system must use fetch API for API communication
- The system must include password strength indicators
- The system must display error messages clearly to users
- The system must use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling

### 6. JWT Token Management

- The system must generate JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- The system must include refresh token functionality
- The system must use environment variables for JWT secrets
- The system must handle token storage securely (frontend responsibility)

### 7. Route Protection

- The system must implement protected routes that require authentication
- The system must redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth` page from any protected route
- The system must treat `/` (home page) as a protected route that shows the dashboard
- The system must treat `/dashboard` as a protected route
- The system must allow access to `/auth` page only for unauthenticated users
- The system must implement client-side route guards using localStorage token validation
- The system must provide loading states during authentication checks

### 8. Error Handling

- The system must return structured error responses for all API endpoints
- The system must include proper HTTP status codes
- The system must provide clear, user-friendly error messages
- The system must handle server errors gracefully

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Email Verification**: Email verification functionality is not included in this scope
2. **Password Reset**: Password reset functionality is not included in this scope
3. **Social Login**: Integration with social media providers is not included
4. **Multi-factor Authentication**: 2FA functionality is not included
5. **Role-based Access Control**: User roles and permissions are not included
6. **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting is not included in this scope
7. **Session Management**: Complex session management beyond JWT is not included
8. **User Profile Management**: Profile editing functionality is not included

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- Use shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Include loading states for form submissions
- Provide clear visual feedback for form validation
- Use password strength indicators with color coding
- Implement proper form accessibility (labels, ARIA attributes)

### Component Structure

- Create reusable form components
- Implement proper form validation with visual feedback
- Use consistent error message styling
- Include proper loading and success states

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- Next.js 15
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL database
- bcrypt for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT handling
- shadcn/ui for frontend components

### Environment Variables Required

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT signing
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`: Secret key for refresh tokens
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

### Security Considerations

- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with salt rounds
- JWT tokens must be signed with secure secrets
- Database connections must use environment variables
- Input validation must be implemented on both client and server
- CORS must be properly configured

## Success Metrics

1. **Functionality**: All registration and login flows work correctly
2. **Security**: Passwords are properly hashed and stored securely
3. **User Experience**: Forms provide clear feedback and error messages
4. **Performance**: API responses are under 500ms
5. **Reliability**: System handles edge cases and errors gracefully
6. **Code Quality**: Code follows best practices and is maintainable

## Open Questions

1. **Password Requirements**: Should we implement any specific password complexity requirements beyond basic validation?
2. **Token Storage**: What is the preferred method for storing JWT tokens on the frontend (localStorage, cookies, or other)?
3. **Error Logging**: Should we implement server-side error logging for debugging purposes?
4. **Database Migrations**: Should we include database migration scripts for production deployment?
5. **Testing Strategy**: What specific test cases should be prioritized for this authentication system?

## Implementation Notes

- The system should be implemented as a standalone authentication module
- All API routes should follow RESTful conventions
- Database schema should be version-controlled with Prisma migrations
- Frontend components should be reusable and well-documented
- Environment variables should be properly validated at startup
- The system should be ready for production deployment with proper security measures
