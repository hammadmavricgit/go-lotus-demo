## Integration Points

### Authentication
- Uses existing `useAuth` hook for user information
- Integrates with Clerk authentication system
- Supports role-based filtering ("Show only my clients")

- Proper layout integration with existing ConditionalLayout

### UI Components
- Leverages existing UI components (Button, Input, Dialog, Tabs)
- Follows established design patterns
- Uses project color scheme (#FC5858 primary color)

## Mock Data Structure

The implementation includes mock data that matches the expected API structure:

```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  dateOfBirth: string;
  associatedStaff: string[];
  thingsToLookOutFor: string;
  status: "Current" | "Waitlisted" | "Archived";
  parentEmail: string;
}
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **API Integration**: Replace mock data with actual API calls
2. **Database Schema**: Define client entity in `.apsorc` file for backend scaffolding
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket or polling for live data updates
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Add date range filters and advanced search options
5. **Export Functionality**: Add CSV/PDF export capabilities
6. **Bulk Operations**: Implement bulk edit/delete functionality
7. **Audit Trail**: Add client history and change tracking
8. **File Attachments**: Support for client documents and images

## Testing

The implementation is ready for testing with the following scenarios:

1. **Tab Navigation**: Switch between different client statuses
2. **Search Functionality**: Test debounced search with various queries
3. **Filter Toggle**: Test "Show only my clients" functionality
4. **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of results
5. **Add Client**: Complete the add client flow with validation
6. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
7. **Accessibility**: Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Performance Considerations

- Debounced search (300ms) prevents excessive API calls
- Pagination limits data loading to 15 items per page
- Memoized filtering prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized component structure for minimal bundle size

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
